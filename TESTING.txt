Testing
=======
To use blob during test, we need to import a module from plone.app.blob
that patches the ZODB. Since we can not unpatch it, and since we have to
import the patch before any test, there is no way to test both blob support
and plone basic support.
Because of that, there are two test runners now.
./bin/test
./bin/test-blob

Coverage
========
There seems to be no way of running the test coverage runner in a way
to only test coverage of p4a.blobstorage. There is also no way to test
coverage of both Blob and File support at once. So no 100% Coverage ever
